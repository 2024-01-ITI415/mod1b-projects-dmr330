# Module1-Projects
 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

The goal for making this project was to use what I learned in RollABall, Apple Picker, and Mission Demolition 
to construct a game that utilizes all of these attributes. In an effort to focus my learning on Unity and 
problem solving, I decided to pick an already existing game, flappy bird. Flappy bird uses many aspects from the 
previous games such as user input, prefab generation and destruction, randomization, scores, etc.
